## Project Overview

- This is an educational website that provides an opportunity to the students or programmers to judge themselves by participating in quiz on several topics.
- I have added four categories of quiz, anybody can pick his subject and start practice.
- React Router has been used to make it a Single Page Application.
- There is a 404 not found page added to handle unrecognized routes.
- A bar chart has been added using recharts to display the total quiz number for different topics.
- There is a blog page where you can get some frequently asked quesion's answer, an accordion using vanilla CSS , React State and optional rendering has been used to serve that FAQ section.
